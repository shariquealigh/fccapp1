            <ul>
              <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
              <li>
                <strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the
                University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program
                known as the "National Youth Administration"
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more
                money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping
                starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All
                of this left scars on me."
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in
                the US Forestry Service
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson.
                Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles
                Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches
                him about breeding pest-resistent plants.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after
                the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military
                asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control
                malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant
                Pathology
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from
                Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to
                head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his
                team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat -
                including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice
                each season, doubling wheat yields
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of
                wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain
                that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of
                Mexico's wheat.
              </li>
              <li>

                time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding
                population
              </li>
              <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
              <li>
                <strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries
                dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at
                Texas A&M University
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world
                food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are
                the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable
                land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because
                "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long
                time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting
                the best breeds."
              </li>
              <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>

            <p>
              Many things grow in Iowa, but few things grow to become as
              inspirational as Dr. Norman Borlaug. We give him credit for
              starting the "Green Revolution." We praise him for saving the
              lives of millions. We honor him for his efforts that have led to
              political stability in international politics. All this… from
              wheat. All this… from Iowa.
